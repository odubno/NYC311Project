# What Do New Yorkers Like to Complain About?

##### Featured on [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/projects/311-data-life-in-nyc/)
  

311 is popular and widely used. Being residents of NYC we were curious to find out what New Yorkers like to complain about, when they complain and where it happens most. 

Data is being sourced from [NYC 311 Data](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9). Complaints are logged daily and we even built an addition to the app where you're able to see live complaints. Otherwise, we focus on the month of February 2018 and what New Yorkers chose to complain about.
